# PyTorch Practice

### The Book

---
I am learning about the PyTorch library (and its associated and commonly coupled libraries) through the book [*Deep Learning with PyTorch - Eli Stevens, Lucas Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann*](https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch).


### Notes structure

---
I have often found the best way to learn computational libraries such as numpy, pandas, TensorFlow, and now PyTorch, is to run along with the book or online documentation in jupyter notebooks. That way, I can quickly run small experiments (and big ones too as required) right alongside the reading material and solidify the fundamental concepts before moving forward.


### My Notes, not yours

---
Note taking is an art.

The way I take notes is my *own*  *__personal__* way. It works for me. It does not have to (and very likely would not) work for other people. The purpose of creating this repository is to primarily keep a regular habit for myself, and secondarily, for others to see an example of how they could take notes.

### Conclusion (sort of)

---
With that being said, enjoy.
